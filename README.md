# Sound Sensor Interfacing with LPC2148  

## Description  
This project demonstrates how to interface a sound sensor with the **LPC2148 microcontroller**, part of the ARM. It captures audio signals from the sound sensor and processes them to perform specific tasks based on the detected sound levels.  

## Features  
- **Sound Detection**: Captures and processes audio signals from the connected sound sensor.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Responds to varying sound levels in real time.  
- **LPC2148 Integration**: Uses GPIO pins and ADC capabilities of LPC2148 for sensor data acquisition. 

## Components Used  
- **LPC2148 Microcontroller**  
- **Sound Sensor Module**  
- **Power Supply Unit**  
- **Connecting Wires**  
- **LEDs (for output indication)**  

## How to Use  
1. **Set Up the Circuit**: Connect the sound sensor module to the LPC2148 microcontroller as per the pin configuration.  
2. **Upload the Code**: Flash the LPC2148 microcontroller with the project code.  
3. **Test the Functionality**: Vary the sound levels near the sensor and observe the corresponding output (e.g., LED indication or buzzer activation).  

## Technologies Used  
- **Embedded C** for programming the LPC2148.  
- **Keil uVision** or equivalent IDE for code development and debugging.  
- **Proteus** or other simulation tools for testing (optional).  

## Applications  
- Home automation systems.  
- Noise-level monitoring in industrial environments.  
- Sound-triggered alerts or alarms.
